# OLTP_Database_Designing
# üóÑÔ∏è Research Projects OLTP Database Design

This repository contains the **end-to-end OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database design** for managing **research projects, agencies, employees, and assignments**.  
It demonstrates both the **Logical Data Model (ERD)** and the **Physical Schema Implementation** in **SQL Server**, following best practices for **normalization, referential integrity, and scalability**.

---

## üìå Project Overview
The database is designed to handle:
- **Agencies** managing research projects
- **Employees** assigned to projects
- **Addresses** shared across multiple agencies
- **Project assignments** with constraints ensuring **data integrity**

This design covers the full lifecycle from **logical modeling (ERD)** to **physical schema creation**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
- **Logical Model (ERD):** Entity-Relationship Diagram defining entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Physical Model (SQL Server):** Tables with `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK` constraints.
- **Normalization:** Up to **3NF** to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
- **Referential Integrity:** Enforced using foreign keys with proper cascading.
- **Composite Keys & Surrogate Keys:** Used for scalability and uniqueness.
- **Incremental IDs:** Implemented via `IDENTITY` in SQL Server.
- **Optimized for OLTP:** Supports frequent inserts/updates with strict integrity.
